                  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
                    During my first week at Flatiron School, I was briefly introduced to the topic of web scraping using the
                    Ruby Gem Nokogiri.  For those who do are not familiar with web scraping, it is extracting data from a
                    website to use it however the end user wants to use that information. Eg: Real Estate Listings gathering,
                    collecting financial data, collecting different prices for products...ect.
	                   While I was playing around with this newly discovered feature and extracting data from websites, I had
                     to ask myself what if I were to use this data for my future website?  It almost felt like it was stealing
                     from someone else’s work to make it my own.  This is where the question I had came to be:  Is scraping Legal?  I decided to do a little more research on regarding the legality of web scraping.
	                   It turns out that web scraping is a grey area that has being going back and forth in the courts over the
                     years.

                <h3 style="display: inline;"><strong>eBay v. Bidder's Edge  </strong></h3>
                <h5 style="display: inline-block;">100 F.Supp.2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2000)</h5>
                  <img src="images/ebay.png" alt="eBay" title="eBay" width="150px", height="60px" style="margin-left: 50px;">
                  <p>
                    The first case challenging web scraping came to be in the year 2000 when eBay sued Bidder’s Edge for
                    scraping data displaying their auction listings on their website.  Ebay used the <strong>Trespass to
                      Chattels Doctrine</strong> arguing that Bidder’s Edge was ignoring repeated requests to stop using
                      crawlers(bots used for automatically scraping the website.)  Ebay also argued that the use of crawlers
                      by Bidder’s Edge was interfering with their servers.  Bidder’s Edge argued that their use of crawlers
                      only generated a slight interference with Ebay’s servers(80,000–100,000 hits per day, representing only
                      1 ½ percent of overall activities on Ebay’s website).  In the end it was ruled in favor of Ebay basically
                      stating that even though the inference had a small impact on Ebay’s site, other scrapers could come along
                      and negativity affect the site.  A <strong>preliminary injunction</strong> was issued as the result of the
                      ruling.

                <h3 style="display: inline;"><strong>Intel Corp. v. Hamidi</strong></h3>
                <h5 style="display: inline-block;">30 Cal. 4th 1342 (2003)</h5>
                  <p>
                    The Trespass to Chattels Doctrine ruling was only to be overturned a few years later in 2003 in the Intel
                    Corp. v. Hamidi case.  It was ruled that Trespass to Chattels could not extend to the context of computers
                    if no actual damage to personal property occurred.  For many years after this ruling, there were a few more
                    cases taking legal action against scraping, however the courts would consistently shoot them down.

                <h3 style="display: inline;"><strong>Facebook v. Power Ventures</strong></h3>
                <h5 style="display: inline-block;"> 844 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (ND California 2012)</h5>
                <img src="images/facebook-create.png" alt="Facebook" title="Facebook" width="150px", height="60px" style="margin-left: 50px;">
                  <p>
                    It wasn’t until 2009 when things start to take a turn in the other direction when Facebook sued Power
                    Ventures for copyright infringement.  Facebook claimed that Power Ventures scraping their content was a
                    violation of their Terms of Service specifically disallowing scraping data from their website.  It was
                    ruled in Facebook’s favor since their Terms of Service did not allow for scraping.
                  </p>

                <h3 style="display: inline;"><strong>QVC Inc. v. Resultly LLC</strong></h3>
                <h5 style="display: inline-block;"> No. 14-06714 (E.D. Pa 2014)</h5>
                  <p>
                    However, the tide would once again turn in the QVC Inc. v. Resultly case filed by QVC against Resultly
                    in 2014.  QVC claimed that Resultly were aggressively using crawlers to scrap their site to the point
                    where it would cause QVC’s servers to shut down causing millions in revenue.  In short, the court ruled
                    that Resultly was not intentionally causing harm and QVC should do more to protect their site from crawlers.

                  <p>
                    The legality of web scraping is still quite murky and it appears that legal action for scraping is quite
                    rare to the point where your everyday common scraping use would ever be bought to court.  However, a
                    scraper should take the following precautions to not only avoid any legal actions against them, but
                    also out of courtesy for the website they are scraping from.
